NavigationDrawerSherlocked
==========================

Android NavigationDrawer with ActionBarSherlock (starter app for those needing both Android's new NavigationDrawer and support for 2.x devices).

Initially the NavigationDrawer worked as planned once ActionBarSherlock was integrated EXCEPT there was a problem where tapping the icon would no longer do anything.  I modified the onOptionsItemSelected() method with another I found on some other website or blog and that combined with my other changes allowed for the icon to be tapped and now opens and closes the drawer.
